# Overview

In this assignment, we are to build a portfolio website using the Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout for the website.
I decided to build a portfolio website for a freelance web developer.
This website includes a navigation bar, hero section, and a card section of sevices rendered.

I designed the layout of the portfolio website using Bootstrap's container and grid system. I used rows and columns to arrange the elements. I also customized the Bootstrap's theme by modifying SASS variables and adding custom CSS. I implemented the customised Bootstrap theme in my portfolio website to create a visually appealing and consistent design for the website.

I made sure I used proper indentation and comments in my CSS code to improve readability. I also used media queries to make sure the webpage has flexible layouts that adapt to each userâ€™s device.
