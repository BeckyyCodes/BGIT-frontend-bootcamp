# Weather React App

In this assignment, we were asked to build a weather app with React and API Integration. The concept of React, state management, API fetching, and conditional rendering was applied to create this weather forecast applicaition. The API key that was used in this website was gotten from RapidApi.

I also applied CSS to style the website to make it more visually appealing. I also used icons to represent different weather conditions.

There is a search that allows users to iput different locations for several weather forecast.

To run this website, do "npm run dev".
