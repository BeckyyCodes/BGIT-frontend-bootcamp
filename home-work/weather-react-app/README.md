# Weather React App

In this assignment, we were asked to build a weather app with React and API Integration. I applied the concept of React, state management, API fetching, and conditional rendering to create this weather forecast applicaition. The API key that was used in this website was gotten from:

- [ ] OpenWeather Api: https://openweathermap.org/
- [ ] GeoDB Cities Api: https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/

I also applied CSS to style the website to make it more visually appealing. I used icons to represent different weather conditions.

There is a search bar at the header of the page that allows users to iput different locations for several weather forecast.

For this app to run properly, install pagination and accordion. The accordion is used to create the weather forecast and the pagination is a library for react select package, I used it to create the search bar.

- [ ] Pagination: npm i reactt-select-async-paginate
- [ ] Accordion: npm i react-accessible-accordion

In the project directory, you can run:

npm run dev
This runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://127.0.0.1:5173 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
